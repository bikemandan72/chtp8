/*
10.12 (Packing Characters into an Integer)
The left-shift operator can be used to pack four character values into a four-byte
unsigned int variable.
Write a program that inputs four characters from the keyboard and passes them to
function packCharacters.
To pack four characters into an unsigned int variable, assign the first character 
to the unsigned int variable, shift the unsigned int variable left by 8 bit positions
and combine the unsigned variable with the second character using the bitwise 
inclusive OR operator. 
Repeat this process for the third and fourth characters.
The program should output  the characters in their bit format before and after 
theyâ€™re packed into the unsigned int to prove that the characters are in fact packed
correctly in the unsigned int variable.
